Hello, my name is Daniel Ralys and I'm 19 years old.

I came from Czech Republic. (beautiful country, known also for beer 🍺)
📚 - I'm currently studying Secondary Technical School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Ostrava.

🎮 - I really loved games since I was a child and I also liked to explore how certain things in games work like, this basically started my huge journey in game development.
I'm currently working on a game called Astrolines, it's sort of a arcade game based in a space. You fight enemy ships in a very interesting way by snapping a line between them,
you can also get powerups and lots of other things. The game is in pretty early stage of development currently, but it's my first bigger project.

This was a short introduction of myself. 
Thank you for visiting my Git. ❤️
